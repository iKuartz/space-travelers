> This web application retrieves real live data from the SpaceX API. It provides commercial and scientific space travel services, by allowing users to book rockets and join selected space missions.
> The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking
> The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier.
> The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.
